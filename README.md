# Android SPV wallets by [Guarda](https://guarda.co)
All Guarda single-currency wallets are available in open-source. 
The wallets are designed to store, manage, transfer and receive cryptocurrency. The applications also include an option to purchase coins with a banking card and top up wallets via the built-in Exchange service.

Guarda does not store any personal information, wallet data or private keys of our clients. The private key is stored in the mobile device’s secure memory and deletes itself if the user logs out from the wallet. In order to secure the funds, a backup of the private key or the json backup feature are created. A pin code access is also available.

## Pull-requests
If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

If you want to add your own coin you need to discover of this files:
```app/src/btc/java/com/guarda/ethereum/managers/WalletManager.java``` - for BTC-like
```app/src/eth/java/com/guarda/ethereum/managers/WalletManager.java``` - for ETH-like

In other cases you need to follow the existing API of ```WalletManager.java``` and implement methods for creating and restore wallet, generating a public address and creating a transaction (or something else specific for your coin).

If you have any question create an [issue](https://github.com/guardaco/guarda-android-wallets/issues/new).
